# KB ablation — per-task effects

Scores are graded against mle-bench private answers (`MLEvolve/utils/grade_all.py`). The agent's own validation metric is not used anywhere here: arms hold out different data, so it is not comparable across arms.

Jigsaw Unintended Bias uses the corrected `jubias-continuous-auc-v1` metric (continuous predictions). Legacy scores that thresholded predictions at 0.5 must not be compared with these results.
