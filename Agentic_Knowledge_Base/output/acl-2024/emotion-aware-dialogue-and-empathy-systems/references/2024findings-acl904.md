# Faithful Persona-based Conversational Dataset Generation with Large Language Models

**TLDR**: Proposes an LLM-based framework for generating high-quality, faithful persona-grounded conversational datasets.

## Abstract

AbstractHigh-quality conversational datasets are essential for developing AI models that can communicate with users.One way to foster deeper interactions between a chatbot and its user is through *personas*, aspects of the user’s character that provide insights into their personality, motivations, and behaviors.Training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models on a diverse and comprehensive persona-based dataset can lead to conversational models that create a deeper connection with the user, and maintain their engagement. In this paper, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a large, high-quality conversational dataset from a seed dataset. We propose a Generator-Critic architecture framework to expand the initial dataset, while improving the quality of its conversations.The Generator is an LLM prompted to output conversations.The Critic consists of a mixture of expert LLMs that control the quality of the generated conversations.These experts select the best generated conversations, which we then use to improve the Generator.We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat, consisting of 20k conversations seeded from Persona-Chat.We evaluate the quality of Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our generation framework on different dimensions through extensive experiments, and observe that the losing rate of Synthetic-Persona-Chat against Persona-Chat during an AI detection test decreases from 17.2% to 8.8% over three iterations.
