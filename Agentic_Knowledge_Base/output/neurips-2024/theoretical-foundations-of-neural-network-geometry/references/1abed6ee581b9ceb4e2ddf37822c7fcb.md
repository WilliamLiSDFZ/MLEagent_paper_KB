**TLDR**: An unconditionally stable recurrent neural circuit implementing divisive normalization is presented with theoretical guarantees and biological plausibility.

## Abstract

Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of "oscillatory recurrent gated neural integrator circuits'' (ORGaNICs), a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.
