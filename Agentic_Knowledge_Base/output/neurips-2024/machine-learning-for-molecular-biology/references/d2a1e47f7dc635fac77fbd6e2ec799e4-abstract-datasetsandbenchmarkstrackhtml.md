**TLDR**: A curated SARS-CoV-2 interaction dataset and VHH antibody sequence corpus is introduced to facilitate training and evaluation of antibody language models.

## Abstract

Antibodies are crucial proteins produced by the immune system to eliminate harmful foreign substances and have become pivotal therapeutic agents for treating human diseases.To accelerate the discovery of antibody therapeutics, there is growing interest in constructing language models using antibody sequences.However, the applicability of pre-trained language models for antibody discovery has not been thoroughly evaluated due to the scarcity of labeled datasets.To overcome these limitations, we introduce AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2, a dataset featuring the antigen-variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibody (VHH) interactions obtained from two alpacas immunized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike proteins.AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2 includes binary labels indicating the binding or non-binding of diverse VHH sequences to 12 SARS-CoV-2 mutants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants.Furthermore, we release VHHCorpus-2M, a pre-training dataset for antibody language models, containing over two million VHH sequences.We report benchmark results for predicting SARS-CoV-2-VHH binding using VHHBERT pre-trained on VHHCorpus-2M and existing general protein and antibody-specific pre-trained language models.These results confirm that AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2 provides valuable benchmarks for evaluating the representation capabilities of antibody language models for binding prediction, thereby facilitating the development of AI-driven antibody discovery.The datasets are available at https://datasets.cognanous.com.
